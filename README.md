This is the grammar I'm tagging:

- Comment
- Command
  - Unknown (deprecated, unused, or just unknown)
  - [Buttons](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting#List_of_key_names) (`SPACE`, `MOUSE1`)
  - Actions (`+attack`, `say_team`)
  - Settings (`bind`, `r_drawviewmodel`)
- Numberic-Literal
- Variable (custom commands)
- Command List (`"+jump; +duck; +attack;"`)
- Punctuation-Semicolon

## Known Issues

- Not [all](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_TF2_console_commands_and_variables) commands have been included yet
- Lazy regex checking, such as `r_\\w+` to mark anything that starts with `r_`, but really should only include exact commands
- My regex has not been reviewed and there's potentially a smarter way to be doing some of the things
- JavaScript name scopes should probably be replaced with something more generic (e.g. `variable.other.readwrite.js`)
